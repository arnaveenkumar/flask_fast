# Tickit

I’m developing a to-do web app that allows users to manage tasks effortlessly. 

## Features

* Improved dark theme.
* Up next:
     * Edit tasks, Create timestamps for the created tasks.
     * Removing the ‘Complete’ button. Users can finish tasks by selecting the radio button in the task list, which will strike through the completed task.
     * Removing the ‘Delete’ button for a cleaner UI. Users can now delete tasks by clicking the ‘X’ icon next to each task.
     * Embedding calender.

I'll be adding several features in the coming days.
