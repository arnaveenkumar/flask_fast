# Tickit

I’m developing a to-do web app that allows users to manage tasks effortlessly. 

## Features

* Added a dark theme
* Up next (1): Edit tasks, Create timestamps for the created tasks.
* Up next (2): Removing the Delete button for a cleaner UI. Users can delete tasks by either checking the radio button or clicking the ‘X’ icon in the task list.
* Up next (3): Embedding calender.

I'll be adding several features in the coming days.
