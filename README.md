# Tickit

I’m developing a to-do web app that allows users to manage tasks effortlessly. 

## Features

* Improved dark theme.
* Removed the "Complete" button; tasks are now marked complete via a checkbox that applies a strikethrough.
* Removed the "Delete" button; tasks are now deleted by clicking the ‘X’ icon next to each task.
* Timestamps are added for the created tasks.
* Upcoming features:
     * Edit tasks.
     * Embedding calender.

I'll be adding several features in the coming days.
