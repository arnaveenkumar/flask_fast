# Tickit

I’m developing a to-do app that allows users to add and remove tasks using a Flask-RESTful API. 

## Features

* Added a dark theme
* Up next (1): Edit tasks, Create timestamps for the created tasks.
* Up next (2): Removing the Delete button for a cleaner UI. Now, users can delete tasks by either checking the radio button or clicking the ‘X’ icon in the task list.
* Up next (3): Calender view.

I'll be adding several features in the coming days.
